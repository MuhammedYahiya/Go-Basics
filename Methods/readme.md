# Value Receiver Method Call:

When a method is defined with a value receiver, it operates on a
copy of the value it is called on. If the method modifies the
fields of the receiver, it modifies only the copy, leaving the
original value unchanged. Value receiver methods are typically
used when the method does not need to modify the receiver or
when the receiver is small and can be efficiently copied.

# Pointer Receiver Method Call:

When a method is defined with a pointer receiver, it operates
directly on the original value (or struct instance) it is
called on. Any modifications made to the fields of the receiver
inside the method affect the original value itself. Pointer
receiver methods are typically used when the method needs to
modify the receiver or when the receiver is large and should
not be copied unnecessarily.

This distinction between value receiver and pointer receiver
methods is important in Go programming, as it affects how
methods interact with data structures and instances of structs.
Understanding when to use each type of receiver is essential
for writing efficient and effective Go code.
